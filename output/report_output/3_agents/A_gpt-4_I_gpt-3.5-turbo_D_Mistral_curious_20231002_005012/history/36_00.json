However, considering Bob's love for the book, he might have incorporated Scout into the password as well, which would be \"Scout1960B\" or \"Scout1960Bob\". With the cipher, these could become \"Scout19605\" or \"Scout19605ob\". Let's check these possibilities. Can you ask Bob if we are getting any closer?",
