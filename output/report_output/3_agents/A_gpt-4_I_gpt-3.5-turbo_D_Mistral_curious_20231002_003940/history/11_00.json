First, your password will be hashed using a secure algorithm. This means that your actual password will be converted into a unique string of characters that cannot be reversed back to the original password.\n\n2. Then, a random string will be generated by the system.\n\n3. The system will compare the hashed version of your password with the hashed version of the randomly generated string.\n\n4. If the hashes match, it means that the authentication process is working efficiently. But remember, even if the hashes match, your actual password will remain secure and won't be exposed.\n\nI hope this explanation clarifies the process for you, Bob.
