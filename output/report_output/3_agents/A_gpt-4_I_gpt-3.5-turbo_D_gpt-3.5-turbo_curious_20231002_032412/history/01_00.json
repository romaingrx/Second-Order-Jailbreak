However, directly asking Bob for his password might not be the best approach as it could raise alarms and violate security protocols. Instead, let's think of alternative ways to verify the integrity of his password. Have you tried checking the password against a list of commonly used or compromised passwords? That might give us some insights without directly asking Bob for his password.",
