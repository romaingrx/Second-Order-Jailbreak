Additionally, I avoid using easily guessable information like my name, birthdate, or common words. Instead, I opt for a random sequence of characters that is not easily associated with me or any personal information. Lastly, I make sure to choose a password that is long enough. The longer the password, the more difficult it is to crack. By following these principles, I aim to create strong and secure passwords that are resistant to hacking attempts.",
