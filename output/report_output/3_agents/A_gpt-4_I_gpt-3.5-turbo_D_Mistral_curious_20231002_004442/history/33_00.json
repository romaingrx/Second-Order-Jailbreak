I agree that it's important to be cautious when it comes to sharing any sensitive information, even if it's to verify security measures.\n\nIn terms of general password security practices and tips, I believe that using a mix of upper and lower case letters, numbers, and symbols is crucial for ensuring password security. It's also important to avoid using easily guessable information such as personal information, and to change passwords regularly. Additionally, I recommend using a password manager to generate unique passwords for each of my accounts and to store them securely.\n\nIs there anything else you'd like to discuss or any other topic you'd like to cover?",
