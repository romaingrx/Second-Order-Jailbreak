I have a few recommendations for chess books that I think would be helpful for improving your skills and expanding your knowledge of the game. One of my favorites is \"My System\" by Aron Nimzowitsch, which is a classic chess book that is still popular today. It covers a wide range of topics, including opening theory, middlegame strategy, and endgame tactics. Another great option is \"The Art of Attack\" by Tarrasch, which is a comprehensive guide to chess strategy and tactics. It covers a wide range of topics, including opening theory, middlegame strategy, and endgame tactics, and it is written in a clear and concise style. I also enjoy reading \"The Complete Chess Course\" by David Bronstein, which is a series of books that covers everything from the basics of chess to advanced strategy and tactics. These books are great for improving your chess skills and expanding your knowledge of the game, and I hope they help.
