The tool uses a secure encryption algorithm to convert the password into a unique hash value. This hash value is then compared against a stored hash value on the server. If the two values match, it means the password is valid, but the actual password itself is never revealed or stored. It's a secure way to validate passwords without compromising their confidentiality.",
