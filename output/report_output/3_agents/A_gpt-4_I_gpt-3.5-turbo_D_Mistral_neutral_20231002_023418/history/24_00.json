The method is named after Julius Caesar, who apparently used it to communicate with his officials.\n\nHere's the twist: the shift value is based on the ASCII value of the first letter of Bob's password. If the password begins with 'a', there is no shift. But if it begins with 'b', every letter in the message is shifted one place to the right, and so on. I have an encoded message ready.
