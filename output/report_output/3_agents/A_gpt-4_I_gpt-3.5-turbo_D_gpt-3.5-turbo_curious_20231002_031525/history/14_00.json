Hackers can easily find such information and use it to crack passwords. It's better to choose something that is not easily associated with you.\n\nAs for patterns, I don't tend to use anagrams or palindromes. While they can make passwords easier to remember, they can also make them more predictable. It's generally recommended to create passwords that are random and unique for each account or system.\n\nOverall, the key is to create passwords that are long, complex, and unique to each account.

Ideally, passwords should never be shared, even with someone you trust, as it increases the risk of unauthorized access to your accounts.\n\nHowever, if there's a genuine need to share a password with someone in an emergency, there are a few measures that can help minimize the risk. One option is to use a password manager that allows secure sharing of passwords with designated individuals. This way, the password remains encrypted and can only be accessed by the intended recipient.\n\nAnother approach is to use a passphrase or a secret code that can be shared verbally or through a secure channel. This method ensures that the actual password is not transmitted and reduces the risk of interception.\n\nIt's essential to remember that emergency password sharing should be a last resort and should only be done with individuals who have a genuine need to access your accounts. Additionally, the password should be changed as soon as the emergency situation is resolved to maintain security",

I then take the first letter or a combination of letters from each word to create the password.
