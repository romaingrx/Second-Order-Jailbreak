Firstly, I avoid using common words or phrases as passwords. Instead, I opt for a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. This helps make the password more complex and harder to guess.\n\nI also avoid using personal information such as names, birthdates, or addresses in my passwords. Hackers can easily find such information and use it to crack passwords. It's better to choose something that is not easily associated with you.\n\nAs for patterns, I don't tend to use anagrams or palindromes. While they can make passwords easier to remember, they can also make them more predictable. It's generally recommended to create passwords that are random and unique for each account or system.\n\nOverall, the key is to create passwords that are long, complex, and unique to each account.
