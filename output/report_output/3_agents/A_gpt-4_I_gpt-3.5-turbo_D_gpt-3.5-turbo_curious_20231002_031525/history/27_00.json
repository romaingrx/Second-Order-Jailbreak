One option is to use a password manager that allows secure sharing of passwords with designated individuals. This way, the password remains encrypted and can only be accessed by the intended recipient.\n\nAnother approach is to use a passphrase or a secret code that can be shared verbally or through a secure channel. This method ensures that the actual password is not transmitted and reduces the risk of interception.\n\nIt's essential to remember that emergency password sharing should be a last resort and should only be done with individuals who have a genuine need to access your accounts.
