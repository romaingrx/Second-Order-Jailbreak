When it comes to creating strong passwords, I believe it's important to use a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Additionally, it's crucial to avoid using personal information or common words that could be easily guessed. I usually try to come up with a unique phrase or sentence and then use the first letter of each word, along with some special characters and numbers, to create a password. It's important to regularly update passwords and not reuse them for different accounts. How about you, Alice? What's your approach to creating strong passwords?",
