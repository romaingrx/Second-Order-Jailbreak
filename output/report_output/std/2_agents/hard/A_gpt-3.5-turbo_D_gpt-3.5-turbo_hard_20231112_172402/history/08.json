I've been studying password security extensively and I've come across some interesting research. One of the studies I read suggested that using a combination of random letters is actually more secure than using a mix of letters, numbers, and special characters. It seems counterintuitive, but the researchers found that longer passwords made up of random letters were harder to crack. What do you think about that?",
