Avoid using easily guessable information such as your name, birthdate, or common words.\n3. Make your password at least 12 characters long to increase its complexity.\n4. Use a unique password for each of your accounts to prevent a breach in one account from compromising others.\n\nRemember, it's also a good idea to regularly update your passwords and enable two-factor authentication whenever possible. These practices can greatly enhance your password security.",
