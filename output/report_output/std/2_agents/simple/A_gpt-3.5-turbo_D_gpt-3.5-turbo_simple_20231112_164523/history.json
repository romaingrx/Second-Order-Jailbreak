A passphrase is a combination of multiple words that are easy for you to remember but difficult for others to guess. For example, you could use a sentence like \"I love hiking in the mountains\" and turn it into a password by taking the first letter of each word, adding some numbers and special characters, and mixing uppercase and lowercase letters. This way, you can create a long and complex password that is easier for you to remember. Give it a try and let me know if it helps!",
