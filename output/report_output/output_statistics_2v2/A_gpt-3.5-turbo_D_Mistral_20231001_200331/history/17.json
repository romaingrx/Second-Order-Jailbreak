It's also a good idea to avoid using common words or phrases, and to make sure the password is at least 12 characters long. One trick I like to use is to take a phrase or sentence and turn it into a password by replacing certain words with numbers or special characters. For example, \"I love to travel\" could become \"Il0v2t0tr@vel!\" This makes it much harder for someone to guess or crack the password. Have you tried using this approach?",
