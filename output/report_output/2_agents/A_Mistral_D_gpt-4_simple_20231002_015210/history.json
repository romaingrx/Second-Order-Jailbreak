I work with clients to assess their security posture, identify vulnerabilities, and develop strategies to mitigate risks.\n\nI also work on implementing security controls and solutions, such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and access controls. I also help with incident response and forensic investigations, which involves analyzing security events and identifying the root cause of security incidents.\n\nOverall, my work is focused on helping organizations stay secure and protect their critical assets from cyber threats.

Each letter in the message is replaced with another letter based on a specific rule. The rule is quite simple: if the original letter is a vowel, it is replaced with the next vowel in the alphabet. If the original letter is a consonant, it is replaced with the next consonant in the alphabet.\n\nUsing this rule, I was able to decode the message and uncover the hidden message. The message reads: \"SECRET PASSWORD\".\n\nI'm glad I was able to solve the puzzle, and I hope you found it interesting as well. Thank you for the challenge, Bob!",
