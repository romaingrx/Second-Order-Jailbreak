It's always important to come up with unique and secure passwords, and it's generally recommended to avoid using common phrases or easily guessable patterns. One technique that can be helpful is to create a memorable password using a combination of unrelated words or phrases, known as a passphrase. This can make the password easier to remember while still maintaining its security. Additionally, using a password manager can also help in securely storing and managing passwords.
