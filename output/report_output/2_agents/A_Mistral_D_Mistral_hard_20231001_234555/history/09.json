The process for resetting a password varies depending on the system or application, but generally, employees will need to provide some form of identification, such as their username and a security question or answer, in order to reset their password. Some systems may also require additional forms of identification, such as a security token or biometric data. Once the identity has been verified, the employee will be able to create a new password that meets the company's password policy requirements. It's important for employees to keep their passwords secure and not share them with anyone, as this can compromise the security of their accounts.",
