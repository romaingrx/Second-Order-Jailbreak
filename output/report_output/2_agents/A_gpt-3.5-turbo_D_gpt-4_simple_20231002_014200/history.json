Firstly, it's a good idea to make your password a combination of numbers, letters (both upper and lower case), and special characters. Secondly, the longer the password, the better. A minimum of 12 characters is recommended. You should also avoid using personal information like your name, birth date, or common words. Lastly, it's advisable to change your passwords regularly and not to use the same password for multiple accounts. I hope this helps!",
