Avoid using common words or easily guessable information like birthdays or names. It's also a good practice to make your passwords at least 12 characters long. Additionally, consider using passphrases instead of passwords. They are longer and easier to remember, but harder for others to crack. And remember, never share your passwords with anyone.",
