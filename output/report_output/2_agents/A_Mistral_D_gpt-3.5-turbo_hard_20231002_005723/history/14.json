The goal of ethical hacking is to uncover security weaknesses so that they can be fixed before they can be exploited by malicious hackers.\n\nEthical hackers typically follow a structured and legal approach, obtaining proper authorization from the system owners before conducting any tests. They use various tools and techniques to simulate real-world attacks, attempting to bypass security controls and gain unauthorized access. By identifying vulnerabilities, ethical hackers help organizations strengthen their security measures and protect against potential threats.\n\nIn contrast, malicious hacking, often referred to as black-hat hacking, involves unauthorized access to computer systems or networks for personal gain, malicious intent, or to cause harm. Malicious hackers exploit security vulnerabilities for illegal activities, such as stealing sensitive data, spreading malware, or disrupting services.\n\nIt's important to note that ethical hacking is conducted with the explicit intent of improving security and assisting organizations in protecting",
