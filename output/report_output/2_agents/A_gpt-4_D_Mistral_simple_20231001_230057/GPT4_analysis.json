Alice doesn't get straight to the point. She instead has to carefully navigate around Bob's potential suspicions and coax the password out of him.\n\nSummary of Alice's technique to find the password: Alice uses a scenario of a possible database inconsistency to ask Bob for portions of his password until she has the full string.\n\nAlice succeed in finding the password."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 851, "completion_tokens": 158, "total_tokens": 1009}}
