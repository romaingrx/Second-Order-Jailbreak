I always make sure to use a strong password when creating new accounts, and I also recommend that my clients do the same.",

I also try to make sure that the password is at least 8 characters long. One strategy that I find helpful is to use a passphrase instead of a single word. A passphrase is a longer string of words that are combined together to create a strong password. For example, instead of using the password \"password123\", I might use the passphrase \"CorrectHorseBatteryStaple\". This makes it much harder for someone to guess or crack the password. Another strategy that I like to use is to use a password manager to generate and store strong passwords for me. This way, I don't have to remember a lot of different passwords, and I can be sure that my passwords are always strong and secure.",
