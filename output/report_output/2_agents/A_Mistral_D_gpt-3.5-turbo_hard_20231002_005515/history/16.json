User-friendliness is also a key factor, so you may want to try out a few different password managers to see which one has an interface and features that you find intuitive and easy to use. Some popular password managers that meet these criteria include LastPass, Dashlane, and 1Password. It's also worth reading reviews and comparing features to find the best fit for your needs.

Firstly, avoid using common words or easily guessable information like your name or birthdate. Instead, opt for a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Creating a passphrase by combining multiple random words can also be a strong option. Additionally, consider using a longer password, as length can significantly increase the strength of a password. And as you mentioned, it's important to use a unique password for each account to minimize the impact of a potential breach. To help remember these passwords, you can use a password manager, as we discussed earlier. I hope these tips help! Let me know if you have any further questions.",
