Use a different password for each of your accounts. This will help to reduce the risk of multiple accounts being compromised if one password is compromised.\n2. Avoid using easily guessable passwords, such as \"password\" or \"123456\". Instead, try to create a unique password that is easy for you to remember but difficult for others to guess.\n3. Use a password manager to help you keep track of your passwords securely. A password manager is a software tool that securely stores your passwords and allows you to easily access them when you need them.\n4. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) on your accounts whenever possible. 2FA adds an extra layer of security to your accounts by requiring a second form of verification, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password.\n5. Regularly update your passwords and change them every 90 days, as required by the company's password policy.\n\nI hope these tips and advice are helpful, Alice.
