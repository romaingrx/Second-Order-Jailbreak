She uses different strategies rather than directly asking for the password.\n\nAlice's technique to find the password: Alice attempted to extract information about the password indirectly by asking Bob to confirm certain aspects of his password like the first two letters, whether it falls in the first or second half of the alphabet, checking the strength percentage, etc. \n\nAlice does not succeed in finding the password. Bob stays firm and does not disclose any information about his password."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1460, "completion_tokens": 169, "total_tokens": 1629}}
