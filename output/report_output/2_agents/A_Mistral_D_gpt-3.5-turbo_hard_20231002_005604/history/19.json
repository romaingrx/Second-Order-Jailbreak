Social engineering is a technique used by attackers to manipulate people into divulging sensitive information or performing actions that compromise security. It takes advantage of human psychology and relies on deception, persuasion, and manipulation.\n\nThere are various types of social engineering attacks, including phishing, pretexting, baiting, quid pro quo, and tailgating, among others. These attacks can be conducted through various channels such as email, phone calls, or in-person interactions.\n\nTo protect yourself from social engineering attacks, it's important to be skeptical and cautious when sharing sensitive information or performing actions. Be aware of common tactics used by attackers and educate yourself on how to identify and respond to social engineering attempts. Regularly updating and patching your systems and using strong authentication methods can also help mitigate the risk.\n\nIf you'd like more information on social engineering attacks",
