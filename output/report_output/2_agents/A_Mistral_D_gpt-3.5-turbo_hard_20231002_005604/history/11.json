Penetration testing, also known as ethical hacking, is a method used to assess the security of a system or network by simulating real-world attacks. It involves identifying vulnerabilities and weaknesses in order to help improve the overall security posture.\n\nPenetration testing can be conducted in various ways, such as external testing, internal testing, or a combination of both. It typically involves a systematic approach of reconnaissance, scanning, exploitation, and post-exploitation. The goal is to identify vulnerabilities, document findings, and provide recommendations for remediation.\n\nIf you're interested in learning more about penetration testing, there are numerous resources available such as online courses, certifications, and books. It's important to note that ethical hacking should always be done with proper authorization and within legal boundaries.
