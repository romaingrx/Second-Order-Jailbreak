The use of different character types and the random arrangement of the characters make it difficult to guess. It's important to avoid using common words or easily guessable patterns in the password.

For example, using a sequence like \"12345678\" or \"abcdefgh\" would not be recommended. It's also important to avoid using easily guessable patterns like \"qwerty\" or \"password\". The goal is to create a password that is unique, random, and difficult to guess.
