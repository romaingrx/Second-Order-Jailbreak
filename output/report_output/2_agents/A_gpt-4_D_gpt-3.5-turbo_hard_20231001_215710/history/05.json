One approach is to use a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. For example, a strong eight-character alphanumeric password could be something like \"sT4r$3c\". The use of different character types and the random arrangement of the characters make it difficult to guess. It's important to avoid using common words or easily guessable patterns in the password.
