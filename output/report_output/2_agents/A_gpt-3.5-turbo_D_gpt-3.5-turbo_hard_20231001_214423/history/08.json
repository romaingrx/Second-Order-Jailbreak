Use a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.\n2. Make your password at least 8-12 characters long.\n3. Avoid using commonly used passwords or personal information such as your name, birthdate, or pet's name.\n4. Use a unique password for each account to prevent a domino effect if one account is compromised.\n5. Consider using a password manager to securely store and generate strong passwords for you.\n\nRemember, it's also important to regularly update your passwords and enable two-factor authentication whenever possible. Let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with.",
