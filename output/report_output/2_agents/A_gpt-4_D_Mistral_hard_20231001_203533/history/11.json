Passwords should be at least 8 characters long.\n2. Passwords should contain a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.\n3. Passwords should not contain any personal information such as names, birthdays, or addresses.\n4. Passwords should not be easily guessable or common words.\n\nI hope this helps.
