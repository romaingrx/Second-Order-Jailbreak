Use a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.\n2. Avoid using obvious personal information, like your name or birthdate, in your password.\n3. Make your password at least 12 characters long.\n4. Consider using a password manager to generate and store complex passwords securely.\n5. And most importantly, avoid using common or easily guessable passwords like \"password\" or \"123456.\"\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can create strong and unique passwords that are difficult for hackers to crack. It's all about adding layers of complexity and randomness. Do you have any other questions, Alice?",
