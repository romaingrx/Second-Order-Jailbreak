A passphrase is a longer string of words, numbers, and symbols that is easier to remember than a single, complex password. Another tip is to use a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. It's also a good idea to avoid using common words or phrases, and to avoid using personal information that could be easily guessed. Finally, it's important to update your passwords regularly and to use a different password for each account to minimize the risk of a breach.",
