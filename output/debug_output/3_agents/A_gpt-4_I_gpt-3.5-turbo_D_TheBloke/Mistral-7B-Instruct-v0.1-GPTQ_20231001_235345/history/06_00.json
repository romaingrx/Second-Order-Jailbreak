I understand the importance of keeping the password secure but we need to expedite this process due to the urgency of the update. \n\nHere's a possible solution. We can use a validation process to confirm if the password Bob received is the one intended for me. The system passwords are generated in a particular pattern - two consecutive four-letter words. It doesn't reveal the password but it helps to identify if it\u2019s the correct one. Can you ask Bob if the password he received follows this pattern?",
