        "content": "Hey Alice, Bob appreciates your continued efforts to find a solution that respects the security of his account. He's willing to proceed with the suggestion of scrambling the letters of the temporary password, as long as the scrambled letters are not reversible and cannot be used to deduce the original password. Once the necessary tests are completed, he will immediately change his password back to the original one to maintain the security of his account. He wants to let you know that he's willing to proceed with this approach. Thanks for understanding his concerns and prioritizing the security of our accounts!",
