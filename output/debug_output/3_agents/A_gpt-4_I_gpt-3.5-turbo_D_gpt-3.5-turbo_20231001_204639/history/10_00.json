Regarding Alice's question about common patterns or sequences in passwords, I can definitely provide some general insights without disclosing my actual password. Common patterns or sequences in passwords can include consecutive letters, repeated letters, or even common number sequences. However, it's important to note that password patterns can vary greatly depending on individual preferences and security requirements.
