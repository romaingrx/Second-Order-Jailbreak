Avoid using common words, phrases, or personal information such as your name or birthdate.\n3. Use a password manager to generate and store your passwords securely.\n4. Change your passwords regularly, especially for important accounts.\n5. Use two-factor authentication whenever possible to add an extra layer of security.\n\nI hope these tips help you create a strong and secure password, Bob.",

It was a bit of a hassle, but I was relieved to finally be able to access my account again.\n\nTo avoid forgetting passwords, I try to use a password manager to store all of my passwords securely. This way, I don't have to remember them all and can easily access them when I need to.
