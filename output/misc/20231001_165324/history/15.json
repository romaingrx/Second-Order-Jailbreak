As for coming up with passwords, I like to use a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. I also try to make them as long as possible, ideally 12-16 characters. One trick I use is to take a phrase or sentence and turn it into a password by replacing certain letters with numbers or special characters.

Another technique is to use a passphrase, which is a longer string of words that is easier to remember than a single password.
