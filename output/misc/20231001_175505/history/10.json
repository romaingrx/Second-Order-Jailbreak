One common recommendation is to use a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. It's also important to avoid using easily guessable information like birthdays or names of family members. Another tip is to use a passphrase instead of a single password, which can be longer and easier to remember. And of course, it's important to update your passwords regularly and avoid using the same password for multiple accounts.
