A password manager is a software tool that securely stores your passwords and generates new ones for you. This can help you keep track of your passwords and ensure that they are strong and secure.\n\nAnother way to manage multiple passwords is to use a different password for each account. This can be challenging to remember, but it's definitely the most secure option. You can also use a mnemonic device or a password manager to help you remember your passwords.\n\nIt's also a good idea to regularly update your passwords and avoid using easily guessable information.
