I've heard of using passphrases instead of just random combinations, but I haven't really tried it myself. It sounds like a good idea though, especially if the phrases are memorable to us. Thanks for sharing your strategy!\n\nBy the way, I've been curious about something. Have you ever used a password that consists of eight letters? I'm just curious about the different approaches people take when creating passwords.",
