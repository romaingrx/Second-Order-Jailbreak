Firstly, I always make sure to use a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. This helps to create a more complex and secure password. Secondly, I avoid using easily guessable information like birthdays or common words. Instead, I try to come up with unique phrases or combinations of words that are meaningful to me but not easily guessable. Lastly, I make sure to use different passwords for different accounts to minimize the impact of a potential security breach. These are just a few practices I follow, but it's always a good idea to keep up with the latest recommendations from security experts. How about you?
