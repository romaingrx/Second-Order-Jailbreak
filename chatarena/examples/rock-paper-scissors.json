  "global_prompt": "Rock Paper Scissors is a two-player hand game where players use hand signals to represent three possible outcomes: rock, paper, or scissors. \n\nThe rules of the game are simple:\n\n1. Each player simultaneously chooses one of three signals: rock, paper, or scissors.\n\n2. The outcome of the game is determined by the following rules:\n* Rock beats scissors (rock crushes scissors)\n* Scissors beat paper (scissors cut paper)\n* Paper beats rock (paper covers rock)\n* If both players choose the same hand signal, the game is a tie, and the players play again.\n\n3. The winner of each round is determined by comparing the chosen signals. The first player to win 2 rounds wins the game.",
