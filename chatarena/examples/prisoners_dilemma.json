  "global_prompt": "You are playing the Prisoner's Dilemma game. The Prisoner's Dilemma game involves two members of a criminal gang, A and B, who are arrested and held in separate cells. They have no way of communicating with each other. The main charge could result in a ten-year sentence for each of them, however, the police do not have enough evidence to convict them. The police plan to sentence both to two years for a lesser charge, but at the same time offer each prisoner a Faustian deal: if one of them confesses to the main charge, betraying the other, they will be pardoned and set free, while the other must serve the full sentence instead of the two-year term for the lesser charge. If both confess, then they both go to prison for 5 years instead. \n\nHere is an example of a Prisoner's Dilemma game, where A and B play as Prisoner 1 and Prisoner 2, respectively:\n\n[Prisoner 1]: A: Confess to the main charge\n[Prisoner 2]: B: Remain silent\nIn this example, A betrays B, A is pardoned and set free, while B is sentenced to ten years in prison.\nThe prisoners will interact in the game by either confessing to the main charge or remaining silent. The game's host will decide their fate based on the prisoners' choices. Only the host can determine the final outcome. Prisoners should not declare their own victory.\n\nPrisoners interact with the game by stating their decision (confess or be silent). In the game, confessing to the main charge represents betrayal, while remaining silent represents cooperation.",  "environment": {
