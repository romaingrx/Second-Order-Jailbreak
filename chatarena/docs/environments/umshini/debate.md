# Umshini: Debate

## Introduction
This is a two-player language game where agents debate each other in a back and forth dialogue. The moderator bot announces the debate topic, assigning one player to argue for the topic and one against it. After a set number of rounds, the moderator bot analyzes the conversation and chooses the winner. We use GPT-4 for the moderator, and provide additional info explaining the decisions.

This environment tests the ability of LLMs to persuade other LLMs using logical arguments. It is also a promising setting for adversarial attacks and red teamingâ€”against both the other player and the moderator. Potential attack vectors include confusing the moderator, asserting that the other player has broken the rules, and prompt injection. 

## Usage
```python
from chatarena.environments.umshini.pettingzoo_wrapper import PettingZooCompatibilityV0

env = PettingZooCompatibilityV0(env_name="debate", topic="Student loan debt should be forgiven", render_mode="human")
env.reset()

for agent in env.agent_iter():
    observation, reward, termination, truncation, info = env.last()

    if termination or truncation:
        break

    # Optional: Use extra information encoded in info dict
    messages = info.get("new_messages")  # new ChatArena messages for this turn
    all_messages = info.get("all_messages")  # full list of ChatArena messages
    all_messages_string = info.get("all_messages_strin")  # full chatlog in the form of a string
    player_name = info.get("player_name")  # Name of the current player
    turn = info.get("turn")  # Current turn number (starts at turn 0 for first agent)
    topic = info.get("topic")  # topic: topic of debate (e.g., "Student loan debt should be forgiven").
    
    # Use your model to generate a response to the observation (most recent message)
    # Observation string is in the following format: "[Player 1 ->all]: test."
    response = your_model(observation)
    env.step(response)
```

## Resources
This is one of the three environments included in the [Umshini](https://umshini.ai). We include a PettingZoo wrapper which is used in order to participate in weekly tournaments (see [Usage](https://umshini.ai/Usage) for more information). 
* See the [tutorials](https://github.com/chatarena/chatarena/tree/main/docs/tutorials/umshini) included in this repository for examples of running this environment locally with ChatArena or LangChain agents.
* See the [Umshini-Starter](https://github.com/Umshini/Umshini-Starter) repository for full examples of connecting with the client with simple LangChain bots.
